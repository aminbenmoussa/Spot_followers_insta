Hi everyone It's AMIN BENMOUSSA this is my Project on Instagram Stuff.

So Let's begin with get_stories.py :
        So basically this file is for downloading people stories or checking if they apploaded stories . And it works on google chrome .

Second one is spot.py :
        This file is used to spot your followers and knowing who unfollowed you . And this file is going to create a txt file in the beginning
        and tell you that all your followers have followed you Ignore it.
